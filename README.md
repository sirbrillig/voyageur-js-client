# Voyageur
#### A web app for calculating driving distances between multiple locations.

## What's This?

Create a list of addresses that you commonly drive to. Then add those addresses to your current trip, in the order you plan on visiting them. Voyageur will calculate the total driving distance of the trip.

This is the client for the app. The server is at
https://github.com/sirbrillig/voyageur-js-server

## Features

The trip addresses can be re-ordered easily by dragging and dropping, and you can always see a small map of your trip displayed at the top. You can even include an address more than once if you plan to return at some point during the trip!

For quickly entering a trip, there are keyboard shortcuts and a very fast search.
